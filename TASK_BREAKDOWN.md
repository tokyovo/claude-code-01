## Task Status Management

### How to Update Task Status

As development progresses, update task status in the tables above:

1. **Starting Work**: Change status from ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started to üîÑ In Progress
2. **Task Completion**: Change status to ‚úÖ Completed when deliverables are met
3. **Blocked Tasks**: Use ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked when waiting for dependencies or external factors
4. **Code Review**: Use üîç Under Review when task is done but needs review/testing
5. **Dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed before starting dependent tasks

### Progress Tracking Tips

- **Daily Updates**: Update task status during daily standups
- **Phase Completion**: Verify all tasks in a phase are ‚úÖ before moving to next phase
- **Critical Path**: Prioritize tasks marked as critical path dependencies
- **Parallel Work**: Multiple agents can work simultaneously on tasks with no dependencies
- **Integration Checkpoints**: Use integration tasks to validate phase completion

### Status Change Examples

```markdown
| **BE-001**: Initialize Node.js/Express | backend-api-developer | None | Working server | üîÑ In Progress |
| **BE-001**: Initialize Node.js/Express | backend-api-developer | None | Working server | ‚úÖ Completed |
```

This system enables real-time project visibility and helps identify bottlenecks or blockers quickly.
